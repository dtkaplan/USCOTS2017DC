# Scottish Hill Race data

```{r include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

These data come from Jessica Utts. They are mentioned in the GAISE 2016 College report.

The times are for the fastest runner in each race.

```{r}
Hillrace <- readr::read_csv("fastest_runner.csv")
Hillrace <- 
  Hillrace %>% 
  gather(key = sex, value = time, male, female)
save(Hillrace, file = "../../data/Hillrace.rda")
```
